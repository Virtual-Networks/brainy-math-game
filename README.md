(Math Game)
Welcome to the Math Game, a fun math challenge where you need to solve math problems that get progressively harder. The higher your level, the tougher the challenge, so get ready to improve your math skills!

(Description)
The game starts at level 1, and you're presented with a random math operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). If you answer correctly, you move to the next level. As you progress, the difficulty increases:

Levels 1-9: Only integer numbers are used.
Levels 10 and above: Decimal (floating point) numbers are introduced.
As the levels increase, decimal multiplication and division with more precision raise the difficulty.
The game ends when you make a mistake, and your final score is displayed. You can choose to play again.

(Requirements)
Python 3.x: Make sure you have an up-to-date version of Python installed.

(How to Play)
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where you downloaded the game.
Run the following command:
python math_game.py
The game will start. Answer the questions and advance through the levels.
If you answer incorrectly, the game ends, and your score will be displayed. You will be asked if you want to play again.
